## Code

The code for Hakyll is freely available on
[github](http://github.com/jaspervdj/Hakyll/). Patches and suggestions are
always very welcome.

## Inspiration

Hakyll is not the only static site generator out there. It was inspired by the
following awesome projects:

- [yst](http://github.com/jgm/yst)
- [nanoc](http://nanoc.stoneship.org/)
- [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)

## License

Hakyll is available under a BSD license. Note, however, that pandoc is
released under a GPL license. Since you'll probably use Hakyll with pandoc,
you will have to license your code under a GPL-compatible license.

## Authors

Hakyll was originally written by [Jasper Van der Jeugt](http://jaspervdj.be),
who still maintains the package. Contributors:
